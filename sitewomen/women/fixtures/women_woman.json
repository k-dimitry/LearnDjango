Madonna's works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. A cultural icon spanning both the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna has become the subject of various scholarly, literary and artistic works, as well as a mini academic sub-discipline called Madonna studies.\r\n\r\nMadonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy & the Emmys, she rose to solo stardom with her 1983 eponymous debut album. Madonna has obtained a total of 18 multi-platinum albums, including Like a Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986), and The Immaculate Collection (1990)—which became some of the best-selling albums in history—as well as Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), her 21st-century bestseller.
